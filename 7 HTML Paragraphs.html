        <p>Browsers always start paragraphs in a new line</p>
        <p>You dont need to do anything</p>
        <p>Browsers always removes extra spaces
            meaning that this paragraph will not look as intended
        </p>

        <p>Browsers not only remove breaks also tabs            this will look as a continuous line</p>

        <p>To fix this we can use "hr" horizontal lines or "br" break lines </p>
        <hr><hr><hr>
        <p>this will be the result, <br>and I think its <br> awesome</p>
        <hr>
        <p> pre is used as preformated text, lets look at it</p>

            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
