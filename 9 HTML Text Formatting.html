        <h1>We are learning about text Formatting</h1>
        <p>First we are going to start with <b>"b" bold </b>text</p>
        <p>then we have <strong>"strong" </strong> text</p>
        <p>we can use <i>"i" italic</i> and <em>"em" emphasized</em> text</p>
        <p><small>"s" small</small> text is useful too</p>
        <p>also we have <mark>"mark"</mark> text and <del>"del"</del> words too</p>
        <p><sub>"sub"</sub> is for subscripted text and <sup>"sup"</sup> is for superscripted</p>
        
        <h2>and maybe this is it for this lesson</h2>
